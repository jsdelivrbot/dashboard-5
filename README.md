# Dashboard app

I have an old first gen Surface Pro laying around and I wanted to put it into use, thus I have a plan to make a simple dashboard app to show, at least for now, weather, my outlook calendar and mail.

This will also be a good way to take a look at Microsoft APIs and see how they work.

This will be hopefully a very simple React/Redux app.
